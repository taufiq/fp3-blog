## Overview
During my stay in SUTD, I learnt more about SUTD has grown as a university, the curriculum and culture they have, a tour and also a workshop on rainbow tables.

### SUTD's culture and curriculum
SUTD mentioned that all year 1 students will go through the same sets of modules and be required to stay in their hostels so that they can  bond more and develop as independent adults. They mentioned that they offer a variety of modules so that students get try out the various areas that SUTD offers (i.e design and engineering). SUTD has gained traction as they are getting listed as a top 10 university for their research work in Artificial Intelligence/Data Science. It was interesting to know that they have a exchange programme as well and students can go as far as germany or as close as countries in South-East Asia (SEA).

### Tour
We went around their university where they showed us the labs they had. A few interesting things were shown, one of them being their fab lab - short for fabrication laboratory. They utilized various machines and had an array of 3D printers and laser cutters that are available for students to use whenever they want to. They had an amazingly huge library and their facilities are up-to-date.

### Workshop
During the workshop, they taught us what rainbow tables. I never realized what the true definition of rainbow tables were and learnt a new concept of reduction. Later on, they had a mini-competition with challenges like breaking an MD5 Hash. With my teammates, we managed to win some waterbottles.

### Conclusion
All in all I am really keen to join SUTD as it seems to fit me more on what I want to do in university. Can't wait to go there!
