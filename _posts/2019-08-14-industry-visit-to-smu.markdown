## Overview
During my trip to NTU, I learn more about the courses that NTU offered. They mentioned about doing a major in computer science and getting a minor in business which definitely interested me. We had an introduction talk and we also went to check out their research centre called **LILY**.

### Introduction Talk
During the talk, the speaker talked about the various courses that NTU offers and what students are given the opportunity to do. They also mentioned about having capstone projects, which was what Ngee Ann Polytechnic's (NP) school of ICT also offers. Additionally, they talked about one of the student's projects, which involved a robot companion to combat loneliness in elderly. A distinctive feature about that is it can understand hokkien speech, showing that the student had to find out how to make speech recognition for the hokkien dialect as there has not been much work around it. 

### LILY
LILY is the research centre of excellence in active living for the elderly. It was really interesting as they showed us various games they used to promote active ageing. One example would be a flying one where they made users mimic a bird flapping it's wing so that it acts as a form of physio therapy. Another example would be a ping-pong game where two ping-pong balls of different colours were thrown at the user and the user is given the instruction to hit the ball of a specific color and avoid the other. It was meant as a way to work on their Eye-Hand coordination and that their minds are exercised.

### Conclusion
Overall I learnt more about NTU and the courses they offered. It definitely piqued my interest and I will consider going there once I graduate from NP.
