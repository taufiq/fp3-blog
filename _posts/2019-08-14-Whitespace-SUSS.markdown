## What happened
There was a talk on cybersecurity by a few speakers who have a job in the cybersecurity industry. THey talked a lot about what the landscape is about and what is needed to get a job related in cybersecurity. I learnt that Singapore ranks 10th in cybersecurity and there is a really high demand when it comes to jobs in the cybersecurity field.

### Notable moments
One of the speakers, Goh Eng Choon, shared an interesting analogy of what cybersecurity is:

> itâ€™s a common guiideline to have 3 guy defending for every man attacking

Thus, it is important to have adequate manpower.

Tristian Chew, who is the chairman of CSIntelligence, also said that technical skills are more important for startups, while government agencies usually look at your academic achievements.
