## Overview
I went to DSTA where they talked about what they do and what they offer. They also had a workshop where I learnt more about the experiments or mini-projects they would do.
### What DSTA is
DSTA plays a supporting role to singapore's army. They provide logistics, and technical support to the army. For example, when it comes to logistics, DSTA is in-charge of engineering support, acquisition of weapons and sensors, and developing technological infrastructures to meet the defence needs of singapore.
### Workshop
During the workshop, DSTA talked about how they can install an app to monitor if a phone has a malware in it. The way they do it is by checking the resource consumption of the phone and if the phone has any extra abnormal behaviour or the resource consumption is abnormally, the app will inform the user of a potential malware. They used pyplot to plot out the consumption data and metasploit to create a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that disguises as an Android application.
### Conclusion
It was cool to see what DSTA offers and how they use technology to improve Singapore's army infrastructure.j
