## Overview
The school hosted a career fair where many companies came to showcase what they're looking for and for us to have an opportunity to interact with them. I spent most of my time in the VKey booth and networking with a former alumni.
## VKey & Networking
I learnt a lot about VKey and they mentioned that they were behind developing the 2FA mobile SingPass app which was pretty cool. But most importantly, I was talking to their marketing executive, who was a Ngee Ann Polytechnic executive, and she told me about how her transitin between jobs were and she said that her diploma and her job role did not match much but it was what she wanted to do. She also talked about her internships in Los Angeles and Australia and recommended me to go overseas for an internship as it would be a new experience where I can learn and grow more as an individual. It was such an enriching conversation!
